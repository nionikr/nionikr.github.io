    <p>My name is XXXXXX XXX, but you can call me Nionikr, Ink, Archiknight, etc.</p>

    <p>There's really nothing special about me at all. However, if you're from Quotev (or even anywhere else, I guess)- I do make covers and am open to be a co-author or an editor.</p>

    <p>Beware, though- I like things that are very much <i>my</i> style. I rip up drafts, and paste them back together much of the time. Explicitly tell me not to, and I'll just be your spell / grammarcheck.</p>

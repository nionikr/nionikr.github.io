        <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
    </div>
    <p><a href="about.html">Visit my About Page here!</a> Also, the Gallery- no, this isn't a link, I'm getting a little tired o making them- there's actually semi-interesting stuff there.</p>
    <p>And a note of semi-interest: the navbar on the gallery page is not sticking to the top of the page. No idea why, will hopefully fix that soon.</p>
    <p>Also, the site's extremely messy. Not especially motivated, but I've really got to learn javascript soon. Html will only get me so far. Did you see that horrible formatting on <a href="webcomicish.html"> Webcomicish</a>?</p>

    <h1>Ah, sheep! The page is gone!</h1>
    <h2>(Error 404, page not found. In other words, you're out of luck.)</h2>
    <h2>This being the case, why don't you try checking my <a href="index.html">main page</a> to see if your missing content is hiding out there?</h2>
    <p>Cya. Au revoir. 再見. Go explore the extremely limited expanses of the website, which should only take about thirty seconds.</p>
    <p>Sincerely, Ink.</p>

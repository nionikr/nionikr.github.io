    <p>While I <i>am</i> rather sad that I am neither smart enough nor talented enough to create webcomics as awesome as Randall Munroe's <a href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a>, I felt like it'd be a waste of time for me to have created this rather sad comic (singular, as of right now) and not post it online for the rather limited world to see it.</p>

    <div id="float">
        <p id="citation"> Created using <a href="https://pixlr.com/editor/">Krita</a>. Inspired by hunger. Title: Hunger. Probably. It shows a stomach that has attempted to copy cells and undergo apoptosis by letting out its acids (instead of lysosomes). Or, you could interpret it as a stomach that was attempting to somehow break down the human's nonexistent stick body around it for more nutrients.</p>
